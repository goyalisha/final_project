          We Will is an application which is launched with the desire of making
          people life easier. Rather than visiting different websites across the
          social media platforms for buying different handmade arts, you can
          find all the handmade arts at one platform that is " we will ". The
          secondary aim of our application is the make people aware about the
          different arts. When people checks in into our app to buy any prouduct
          , they will see different blocks of handmade arts which in turn will
          let them know about the variety of handmade arts. Our community is
          also here to provide platform to those who lacks knowledge of selling
          products online. We guide every individual who makes handmade arts. We
          elaborate them in all possible ways so that they can make their sales
          higher by selling their product online.
